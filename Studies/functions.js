/**
 * FUNCTIONS
 * 
 * 0. A function allows us to encapsulate a block of code, and execute that block of code whenever we want. 
 * It's a set of statements that perform a task or calculate a value. 
 * 
 * 
 * 1. The first phase of function is to "create" the action, also known as function decleration or function 
 * definition. In this phase we want the action to be performed on multiple possible values, so we don't need
 * to put any concrete values. we only use placeholders or the "parameters" that act as stand-ins for the values.
 * 
 * 2. The second phase is we have to invoke our function by creating ang "function call". The function call/invocation
 * consist of two parts; the name of the function you would like to invoke, and "arguments" - the actual values you'd 
 * like to invoke the function on, enclosed in parenthesis (). 
 *
 * 3. Whatâ€™s the syntax for a NAMED function?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 4. How do we assign a function to a variable?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specify
 *  inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function
 *  and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures! (See: our meeting-room app for an example!) (ALSO, see: Understanding JavaScript Closures with Ease)
