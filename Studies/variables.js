/**
* VARIABLES:
*
* 0. Variables are containers for storing data. For any program that we create,
* we need a method to create and store values that we can use throughout the 
* application. Variables can contain just about anything, not just strings and
* numbers, anything can vary. In Javascript, a variable stores a data value that
* can be changed later on.
*
* 1. To create or declare a variable, we use the var keyword, and followed by the
* name of the variable that we chose.
